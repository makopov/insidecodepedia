# INSIDECODEPEDIA
This is a small collection of problems and algorithms I find useful when learning a new programming language.
If you're like me and you enjoy learning new languages but sometimes don't know if you're doing it "right" then this might be for you.

# How it works
Solve the following algorithms/problems in a language you're most comfortable with, getting familiar with the problems. Then attempt to write them again in a new language. You'll know what to look for, and how it should be implemented.

Try it, if you have solutions for other languages or problems you think might be useful to add to this collection then feel free to submit a pull request.

## Problems
- is_prime, determining if a number is a prime.
